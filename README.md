Mod 3 - Full Stack MERN App

Welcome to the Task Manager App! This project is a full stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The app is a simple task manager that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

The following are a few screenshots of the app:

The technologies utilized in creating this application are as follows:
· MongoDB/Mongoose
· Express
· React
· Node.js
· Axios
· JWT
· bcrypt
· Bootstrap
· GitHub, Trello, Lucid.app

Getting Started:

Trello was used simply as a means of keeping track of what needed to be done on the application and to break down the various parts:

The application's front end and back end were both deployed via render.com:

Unsolved problems:

Although the application was deployed through render.com, there is a timeout that happens which prevents the user from logging in or registering.

Future Enhancements:

I plan to incorporate a cleaner interface and better integrations of pictures.
